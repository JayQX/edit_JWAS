In MCMC_BayesC,
conventional methods, sol may have NA there but those NA  are usually corresponding to
missing values, which won't affect the results. Because

1) Get NA in sol when solve
    Gibbs(mme.mmeLhs,sol,mme.mmeRhs)
  because several diagonal elements of mme.mmeLhs are zeros.
Dorian: Maybe better keeping previous sample when dignal is zero.

1)sample_missing_residual will only use  the non-NA part in ySparse ,the these sampled missing
residuals are only used for calculate residual variance.
2)when construct mmeLHS, NA part in ysparse actually is not used (not affect Lhs)
(Based on my experiment, always NAN in sol when Gibbs(mmeLhs,sol,mmeRhs))

For conventional one,
if mme.M != 0
  mme.R = R0
  R0    = mme.R
  Ri    = kron(inv(R0),speye(nObs))
end

if mme.M == 0
  mme.R = R0
  RiNotUsing   = mkRi(mme,df) #for missing value;updata mme.ResVar
  Ri = RiNotUsing
end

The second one is used, this is because lhs is construct with ySparse, in which missing elements NA
are denoted as 0, but not updated (different form ycorr in marker) with

resVec = (mme.M==0?(mme.ySparse - mme.X*sol):ycorr)
#here resVec is alias for ycor ***
if missing_phenotypes==true
  sampleMissingResiduals(mme,resVec)
end

Thus only the first second one (mme.M ==0) should be used, constructing the
tricky R to get rid of the effect of NA(0) in ySparse. If wanna use 1 mme.M!=0,
NA in ySparse should be updated with resVec+ other effects part.

On the country ycorr in Marker methods is updated with resVec (Have to , because ycorr used in BayesC)
Thus, should use (if mme.M != 0 kron(inv(R0),speye(nObs)))

But in maker stuff,
If NA in sol, there will be NA in ycor, which is also used in markersampler part.
Not like conventional methods, only y sparse is used and won't affect mmeLhs and mmeRhs if use the
tricky way construct mmeLhs, mmeRhs.
