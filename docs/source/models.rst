Models
======

The starting point for these methods is a mixed linear model of the form:

.. math::

  \boldsymbol{y=X\beta+Z\alpha+e}

where :math:`y` is an nx1 vector of trait phenotypic values,  :math:`X` is an nxp incidence matrix relating 
the vector  :math:`\beta` of non-genetic fixed effects to
