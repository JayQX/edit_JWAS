Models
======

The starting point for these methods is a mixed linear model of the form:

.. math::

  \boldsymbol{y=X\beta+Z\alpha+e}

where :math:`y` is an nx1 vector of trait phenotypic values,  :math:`X` is an nxp incidence matrix relating 
the vector  :math:`\beta` of non-genetic fixed effects to  

where :math:`y` is an :math:`n\times 1` vector of trait
phenotypic values, :math:`\bo{X}` is an :math:`n\times p` incidence matrix relating
the vector :math:`\bo{\beta}` of non-genetic fixed effects to :math:`\bo{y}`, :math:`\bo{Z}`
is an :math:`n\times k` matrix of genotype covariates (coded as 0, 1 or 2)
for :math:`k` SNP markers, :math:`\bo{\alpha}` is a :math:`k\times 1` vector of random
partial regression coefficients of the :math:`k` SNPs (which are more
commonly referred to as the marker effects), and :math:`\bo{e}` is a
vector of residuals.
