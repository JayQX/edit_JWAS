JWAS is a well-documented software platform based on Julia and an interactive Jupyter notebook for analyses of general
univariate and multivariate Bayesian mixed effects models.  These models are especially useful for, but not limited to,
routine single-trait and multi-trait genomic prediction and genome-wide association studies using either complete or incomplete
genomic data ("single-step" methods). Currently, JWAS provides broad scope of analyses, e.g., a wide collection of Bayesian
methods for whole-genome analyses, including shrinkage estimation and variable selection methods. The features of JWAS include:

* No limitations on fixed effects (e.g. herd-year, age, sex)                                                                    
* Random effects other than markers (e.g. litter, pen)                                  
* Random effects using pedigree information                                                                                
* Random permanent environmental effects  
* Single-trait analyses                                            
* Multi-trait analyses                                                                  
* Use of genomic information                                                                                
* Complete genomic data                                      		
* Incomplete genomic data
* Correlated residuals
